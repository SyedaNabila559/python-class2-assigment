# Example 3: Using `in` with a tuple
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(3 in numbers)  # Output: True (3 is in the tuple)
print(5 in numbers)  # Output: False (5 is not in the tuple)

#  Using not in
# Example 4: Using `not in` with a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print('grape' not in fruits)  # Output: True (grape is not in the list)
print('banana' not in fruits)  # Output: False (banana is in the list)

# Example 5: Using `not in` with a string
text = "Hello, world!"
print('Python' not in text)  # Output: True (Python is not in the string)
print('world' not in text)  # Output: False (world is in the string)

# Example 6: Using `not in` with a tuple
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(5 not in numbers)  # Output: True (5 is not in the tuple)
print(2 not in numbers)  # Output: False (2 is in the tuple)

# 7) ****  Bitwise operators ****

# Bitwise AND (&)
a = 5   # 0101 in binary

#  Bitwise XOR (^)
a = 5   # 0101 in binary
b = 3   # 0011 in binary

# Bitwise Left Shift (<<)
a = 5   # 0101 in binary
result = a << 1  # Shifting the bits 1 position to the left
